## About Me

I am a graduate student at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), specializing in artificial intelligence research.

My academic interests include:
- Machine Learning
- Federated Learning
- Non-IID data handling
- Diffusion models for data augmentation
- Privacy-preserving machine learning (e.g., Differential Privacy)

My current research focuses on improving performance and fairness in federated systems under data heterogeneity. I am particularly interested in combining diffusion models and federated learning to enhance data representation and personalization.
